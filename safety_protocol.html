			<p>We all know the worst part of COVID(except the lockdown.) MASKS! We couldn't even breathe through that. Masks will probably be mandatory during your school time. Please only take off your masks when allowed to ensure a safe environment. No masking outdoors will probably be permitted but ensure that it is via your teacher.</p>

			<h2 class="section-header1">KEEP ON KEEPING YOUR DISTANCE</h2>
			<p>The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads easily through physical contact from person to person. This is why it is important to reduce the ways people come in close contact with one another. An effective way to do this is to stay home as much as possible and avoid crowded, public places where it is difficult to keep a safe space between people.</p>
