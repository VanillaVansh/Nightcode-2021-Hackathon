			<p>This Guide was created in mind of providing you safe, authorized an useful information about going back to in-person school in this year. </p>
			
			<p>The School Nerds Association (SNA) is a professional association established in
				2021 to represent the interests and concerns of occupational therapy practitioners and students, and to improve
				the quality of occupational therapy services. The practice of occupational therapy is science-driven, evidence based, and enables people of all ages to live life to its fullest by promoting health and addressing the functional
				effects of illness, injury, and disability. Occupational therapy practitioners work with people of all ages to maximize
				independence and function. This includes considering how person, place, and environment influence occupations.
				In occupational therapy, occupations are the purposeful activities in a personâ€™s day. For children, these include play,
				school, self-care (dressing, eating, etc.) and other activities</p>
