			<h2 class="section-header1">PREPARE FOR SCHOOL THE NIGHT BEFORE</h2>
			</p>

			<p>Mornings are always chaotic, thus being prepared the night before helps you to unclutter your morning routine. It doesnâ€™t require hours as a little extra preparation could make your day run smoothly. This is especially helpful for students who are usually running late. To minimize the workload in the morning, all you have to do is to pack your backpack and iron your uniform the night before.

			<h2 class="section-header1">MAINTAIN SLEEP SCHEDULE</h2>
			<p>Getting good sleep is a key to kick start your day with a dash of freshness. There could be nothing worse than feeling drowsy and lethargic throughout your day at school. One must get at least eight hours of sleep every night. To achieve this, a strict sleep schedule is a must, and it should be maintained even on the weekends. Afternoon naps also play a vital role in boosting the performance of the day. Managing your nap time in multiples of 90 minutes also helps you to wake up naturally and energized.</p> <br>
			<h2 class="section-header1">EAT RIGHT</h2>
			<p>The right food helps your brain to function better and the better your brain functions, the better you perform at school. Eating right includes both, a timely as well as a nutritious meal. It is advised that you should never skip a meal. You should pack meals that are healthy and induce you with energy. Healthier lunch options provided by schools and planned by a proper dietician helps the students to develop wholesome eating habits. Many schools provide food but it becomes imperative to find out which school follows a proper diet chart for children.</p>
